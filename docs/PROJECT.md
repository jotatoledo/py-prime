## Project structure

The project boilerplatte, eg. structure, was generated using [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) with the [cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal](https://github.com/kragniz/cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal) template.

Changes based on the structure section of [the hitchikers guide to python](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/), specially regarding the
`tests` folder were undertook.
